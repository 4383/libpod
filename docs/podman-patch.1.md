## DESCRIPTION
`podman patch` patch an existing running container file. If user pass
the flag `--all` all the running containers are patched.
If the file to patch doesn't exist inside the running container

where the running container doesn't have the file to patch the `--ignore-fail` flag can be pass
and then the command continue to run on other containers.

flag was passed by user then `podman patch` skip to apply the patch and 
continue on other containers.
